Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)


TODO:
* Change to have only 2 modes: place (anything) or delete circle?
  * click on a circle to add/toggle power node
  * click and drag from a circle to do a line
  * click in empty space to add a new circle
  * or: no mode: just have right click be delete?
* Do X through Power to indicate deleting, not red circle
* Highlight all lines and power red when highlighting a circle that would be deleted
* Drag to create lines
* hover/etc is pretty crappy on mobile (post-jam fix?)
