Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

TODO:
* better demon heads
* SFX
* Music
* SFX/Music toggles
* zen mode toggle
* Change level 10 notification to use overlay screen
* Copy circle from previous if no save?  Start completely fresh beyond the first one?  Something more interesting as default?
* Do X through Power to indicate deleting, not red circle
* Highlight all lines and power red when highlighting a circle that would be deleted
* hover/etc is pretty crappy on mobile (post-jam fix?)
* fade runes

Polish / Bugs:
* Remove short line when drawing a larger line directly over it
* Remove short line when a power node completely consumes it
* Noisy BG grain texture
* portrait mode display
