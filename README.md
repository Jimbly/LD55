Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

TODO:
* new button graphic
* Copy circle from previous if no save?  Start completely fresh beyond the first one?  Something more interesting as default?
* hover/etc is pretty crappy on mobile (post-jam fix?)
* Noisy BG grain texture

Polish / Bugs:
* Remove short line when drawing a larger line directly over it
* Remove short line when a power node completely consumes it
* portrait mode display
